<p>[++++++++++++++++++++++++]</p>
<p>Previously, students counted and made connections between quantities and spoken number words. In this section, students write numbers to represent quantities. To develop studentsâ€™ familiarity with written numbers, consider providing a reference sheet with numbers and quantities in 5-frames.</p>

<p>Students also explore new counting tasks: counting images arranged in a circle, and counting objects or drawing images to represent given numbers. Images arranged in a circle are harder to quantify than those in lines, arrays, or frames because there is no defined starting or stopping point. It requires students to develop a method to keep track of which images they have counted.</p>

<p>Creating or drawing a collection with a specified number of items is also more demanding as students need to keep track of the number they are representing and how many they have already counted.

    <p>In many activities, students have opportunities to look for and make use of structure to help them with the tasks at hand (MP7).</p>
    <p>Two new centers, Math Libs and Bingo, are introduced in this section.</p>
