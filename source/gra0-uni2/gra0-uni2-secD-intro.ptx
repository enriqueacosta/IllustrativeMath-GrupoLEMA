<p>[++++++++++++++++++++++++++++]</p>
<p>In this section, students develop their capacity to compare written numbers. As they count, students can see that the numbers get larger and that there is 1 more each time. Here, they determine “1 more” and “1 less” than a given number or group of objects, strengthening their understanding of the relationships between numbers and the foundation for comparing numbers.

<p>Students may compare written numbers in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create representations of each number and use the representations to compare.</li>
<li>Use number sense (for instance, that 10 is a “big” number) or mental images of numbers (for instance, 4 relates to 4 fingers).</li>
<li>Use the knowledge of the count sequence: that numbers that come later in the count sequence are greater.</li>
</ul>

<p>Students who use number sense or mental images may be able to easily compare some numbers but not others. For instance, they may know that 9 is close to 10 or all the fingers in two hands and 4 is associated with fingers in one hand, so 9 is more than 4.</p>
