<p>[+++++++++++++++]</p>
<p>In this section, students reason about area as an attribute of two-dimensional shapes and develop a sense of area as the amount of space covered by a shape.</p>
<p>They begin by considering how to show or explain a shape as being larger or smaller than another. Next, they see that they can quantify the size of shapes more precisely by covering them with units of the same size, such as pattern blocks or square tiles.</p>

<p>Students then learn that the area of a shape is the number of squares that covers it with no gaps or overlaps. To find the number of square tiles used to cover a space, students may skip-count or use multiplication.</p>
