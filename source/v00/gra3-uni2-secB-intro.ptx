<p>[+++++++++++++++]</p>
<p>Students see equal-size groups in rectangles that are tiled with squares. They learn to express the area of rectangles as a product of two numbers that describe the equal groups. For example, in a rectangle that is 8 units by 4 units, students see 8 groups of 4 or 4 groups of 8. The product of the two numbers, <m>8\times 4</m> or <m>4\times 8</m>, gives the number of squares that covers a rectangle completely with no gaps or overlaps. </p>

<p>Use of the structure of a rectangle enables students to transition from gridded rectangles to rectangles showing only side lengths (MP7). The progression in visual representations matches the progression in strategies for reasoning about area: moving from concrete (counting) to abstract (finding products of two numbers).</p>

<p>In this section, students also learn about standard units of area in inches, feet, centimeters, and meters. They explore these units in the context of real-world and mathematical problems.</p>
